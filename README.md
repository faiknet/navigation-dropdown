# Frontend Mentor Challenge
This project is a solution to the [Intro section with dropdown navigation](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-ryaPetHE5) challenge from Frontend Mentor. This project was built using React and Tailwind CSS.

## Brief

The challenge was to build the intro section of this website with dropdown navigation, getting it to look as close to the original design as possible.

The user as a result should be able to: 

* View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
* View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
* See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Challenges and Takeaways 
While creating this project, I enjoyed the challenge of navigating the different use states, some of which required multiple states to be used simultaneously to achieve desired effects. This helped me experiment with different use cases and understand how the application would behave in different scenarios.

However, I found that maintaining a responsive design was crucial to ensure the application remained functional and visually appealing across different devices and screen sizes. This required careful consideration of the design of each component and its interaction with the rest of the application, as well as ensuring the layout was flexible enough to adapt to different screen sizes while maintaining functionality and visual appeal. Overall, this challenge was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to practice my design skills and explore different use cases.
